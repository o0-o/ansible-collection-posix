# o0_o.posix

Ansible Collection for POSIX-compatible modules and action plugins with raw fallback support.

## Overview

The `o0_o.posix` collection provides enhanced versions of common Ansible modules with quality-of-life improvements and built-in fallback logic for environments that lack a Python interpreter. These tools are especially useful for bootstrapping hosts in mixed environments that include minimal or embedded systems.

### Key Features

- Fallback to raw POSIX tools (`sh`, `cat`, etc.) when Python is missing
- Check mode, async, and idempotence support where applicable
- Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage
- _Mostly_ drop-in replacements for `ansible.builtin.command` and `ansible.builtin.slurp` behavior

## Plugins

### Action Plugins

| Name       | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `command`  | Enhanced `command` module with raw execution fallback and _nearly_ full param parity |
| `slurp64`  | Read remote file contents with automatic base64 decoding, fallback to raw `cat`       |

### Module Stubs

These exist to support `ansible-doc` and collection metadata. Do not use directly.

- `command`: see [`plugins/action/command.py`](plugins/action/command.py)
- `slurp64`: see [`plugins/action/slurp64.py`](plugins/action/slurp64.py)

## Usage

### `command`

```yaml
- name: Run a command with fallback support
  o0_o.posix.command:
    argv: ["uptime"]

- name: Run a shell command with variable expansion
  o0_o.posix.command:
    cmd: "echo $HOME"
    _uses_shell: true
    expand_argument_vars: true
```

### `slurp64`

```yaml
- name: Read file content with slurp64
  o0_o.posix.slurp64:
    src: "/etc/hosts"
```
